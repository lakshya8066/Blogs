# About in-toto

[In-toto](https://in-toto.io/) is a framework designed to protect software supply chain integrity. It provides security against attackers who can get control of a step in the supply chain and alter the product for malicious intents like introducing a backdoor in the source code and including vulnerable libraries in the final product. To address these issues, in-toto, cryptographically ensures the integrity of the software supply chain and makes sure that all the steps within the supply chain are clearly laid out. It achieves that by providing integrity, authentication, and auditability to the supply chain as a whole. in-toto provides the semantics or the language to define policies, called a layout. The actual project owners define the layout file which dictates the series of steps that need to be carried out in the SSC(Software supply chain) in order to create a final product. Through the course of the build, a file called a link metadata is generated which gathers and stores information about the commands and files related to each step of the build.   
In-toto can significantly reduce an attackerâ€™s opportunity when used in conjunction with other techniques described in the [CNCF whitepaper](https://www.cncf.io/reports/cloud-native-security-whitepaper/) and [SLSA](https://slsa.dev/spec/v0.1/levels)(Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts) levels.

# Goal of the project

The goal of the project is to add support for a new predicate called [SLSA Provenance](https://slsa.dev/provenance/v0.2) along with the old Link predicate in the in-toto attestation. This new predicate not only gathers information that the original link metadata did but also extra information that will describe when, where, and how the software artifacts were produced. Information like the ID of the builder, the source that triggered the build, the start time, and the end time of the build. (See below snippet for [more])

# Implementation of project

## 1. Refactor the code

The in-toto-java library is useful in connecting Jenkins with in-toto. The in-toto-java library containing the model code for SLSA Provenance used Java 11. So the first task was to update the `pom.xml` of the maven project that built the plugin with Java 11. This [Pull Request](https://github.com/in-toto/in-toto-jenkins-plugin/pull/4) contains the changes made to the pom.xml that upgrade the dependencies to the latest version as well as remove some redundant dependencies that are no longer of use. 

The major portion of this update was to make every dependency compatible with Java 11. Once the PR was merged, we also had to update the Java version in the CI system of Jenkins tests. The [Pull Request](https://github.com/jenkinsci/in-toto-plugin/pull/30) for the same.

With the refactoring done, we got the plugin up and running with Java 11, it was time to work on setting up a class and sub-class structure that would depict the metadata format as required by the SLSA Provenance. 

![Provenance Metadata](/images/example.png)

The code for version 0.1 of SLSA Provenance was already present in the in-toto-java library but not for version 0.2. There are slight changes between the two. This came up in one of our meetings that we should have support for both versions to expand the usage of the library. So, the next task was to add a class-based hierarchy and create a sort of parent data structure that had a place for every felid of the Provenance metadata. 
This [Pull Request](https://github.com/in-toto/in-toto-java/pull/64) contains the code to shift the existing code for version 0.1 to a new dedicated directory. 

After putting the code for v0.1 in a dedicated directory, I started working on creating a model for v0.2. The code for version 0.2 of SLSA Provenance resides in a new directory and this [Pull Request](https://github.com/in-toto/in-toto-java/pull/40) achieves that. There are minor changes from [v0.2](https://slsa.dev/provenance/v0.2) to [v0.1](https://slsa.dev/provenance/v0.1) of SLSA Provenance and this pull request updates the the data structure with the changes.
The first half of the project ends here where we complete the basic setup and preparation to structure the metadata.

## 2. Gather information and add support for Provenance metadata in the plugin  

Now that the structure for the metadata is ready in the in-toto-java library, we can use it to store the metadata. Since the definitions of the fields in the metadata are flexible, there was a lot of discussion around how we want to use them. This [Pull Request](https://github.com/in-toto/in-toto-jenkins-plugin/pull/5) adds support for a new predicate i.e SLSA Provenance v0.2 that gathers information from each step of the build, stores it in a txt file and dumps it in the local directory. 

To demonstrate the working of the plugin, we can use a demo project https://github.com/lakshya8066/in-toto-demo/tree/test-plugin
A Jenkinsfile is present in the repository that triggers the build. This is a pipeline that has two steps. The first step is a 'build' step performed by a functionary Bob. The second step compresses the project into a tarball performed by functionary Carl.

```
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                in_toto_wrap(['stepName': 'Build',
                    'keyPath': '/var/lib/jenkins/workspace/Test/functionary_bob/bob',
                    'transport': '']) {
                        echo 'Building..'
                    }
                in_toto_wrap(['stepName': 'Package',
                    'keyPath': '/var/lib/jenkins/workspace/Test/functionary_carl/carl',
                    'transport': '']){
                        sh label: "compress-for-release", script: "tar --exclude .git -zcvf demo-project.tar.gz . && set +e"
                    }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
This pipeline generates two metadata files. These files contain a lot of very crucial and small information regarding the build of the project. An example of a SLSA Provenance metadata v0.2 is attached below. The project used to generate this metadata file can be found here https://github.com/lakshya8066/in-toto-demo/tree/test-plugin.
